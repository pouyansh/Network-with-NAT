# Network-with-NAT

I did this project about 4 months ago on another git which our university made for us and now I decided to upload it here. that's why I commit it all in once. 
There is a code which is related to PARTOV company and it prepares the network requirements and our task was just to write the code of Clinet, Server, and NAT which you can see in this repository.
